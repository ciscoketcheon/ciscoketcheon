i1. Dismount the database (run this on exchange server mail1, from Exch mgmt shell, not powershell)-> 
 > Dismount-Database -Identity "DB02"

2. Move the database to C:
> Move-DatabasePath -Identity "DB02" -LogFolderPath "C:\Mailbox\Logs" -EdbFilePath "C:\Mailbox\DB02\DB02.edb"

 (grab a coffee, took 5-10min)

3. Re-mount the database
> Mount-Database -Identity "DB02"

After this, you should be able to reconnect outlook and see the Inbox from the Wskt1. 
Partition C: will have 9Gb+ free space left, should be able to run for many days.
